===''Airplane!'' and ''The Naked Gun''===
{{Main|Airplane!|The Naked Gun}}
Nielsen's supporting role of Dr. Rumack in [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]]'s 1980's ''Airplane!'' was a turning point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as ''[[Zero Hour!]]'' and ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included [[Robert Stack]], [[Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him.

[[File:Airplane screenshot Haggerty Nielsen.jpg|thumb|left|Leslie Nielsen (right) in the role that established him as a comedic actor: Dr. Rumack in the 1980 movie ''[[Airplane!]]'']]
The directors cast Nielsen for his ability to play like "a fish in water", saying "You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly&nbsp;... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy."<ref name="MIL"/> For Nielsen, ''Airplane!'' marked a shift from dramatic roles to [[deadpan|deadpan comedy]]. When it was suggested his role in ''Airplane!'' was [[Typecasting (acting)|against type]], Nielsen protested that he had "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what he always wanted to do.<ref name="CastType">{{cite news |last=Dalton |first=Andrew |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title='Airplane!', 'Forbidden Planet' actor Nielsen dies |work=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]] |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ufWUN5CO?url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archivedate= 2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series ''Police Squad!''. The series introduced Nielsen as [[Frank Drebin]], the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.

''Police Squad'''s opening sequence was based on the 1950s show ''[[M Squad]]'', which starred [[Lee Marvin]], and opened with footage of a [[police car]] roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The [[Hank Simms]] voice-over and the show's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to [[Quinn Martin]] police dramas including ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', and ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]''. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him. Although the show lasted only six episodes, Nielsen received an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/leslie-nielsen |title=Leslie Nielsen |work=Television Academy}}</ref> nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].<ref name="BIO">{{cite web |title=Leslie Nielsen |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]] |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/150:519/1/Leslie_Nielsen.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ufWoKHlM?url=http://public2.bio.lalababy.co.uk/biographies/leslie-nielsen.html |archivedate= 2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

Six years after cancellation of ''Police Squad!'', the film ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: "You have an idea of how you're going to do something, and it's your vision&nbsp;... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance."<ref name="KJZZ"/> This movie grossed over $78&nbsp;million and was well received by critics.<ref name="MOJO">{{cite web |title=The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nakedgun.htm |accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="RT2">{{cite web |title=The Naked Gun – From the Files of Police Squad!

''The Naked Gun'' spawned two sequels: ''[[The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear]]'' (1991) and ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' (1994). ''Naked Gun 2½'' grossed more than the original, with $86.9 million, while ''Naked Gun 33⅓'' grossed $51.1 million.<ref name="MOJO2">{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thenakedgun2.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="MOJO3">{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thenakedgun3.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> Nielsen remained open to a fourth ''Naked Gun'' film, although he doubted that it would be produced — "I don't think so", he said in 2005.

Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and [[George Kennedy]]) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of [[the Undertaker]], who had disappeared at January's [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] event. At [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam 1994]], in a ''Naked Gun'' parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find the Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut), thus they solved the mystery.<ref name=wcrap>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy |author2=R.D. Reynolds |publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|page=168|isbn=1-55022-584-7}}</ref> In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for [[Red Rock Cider]].

Noncomedic roles after ''Airplane!'' included ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980) and ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), both horror films, and as a dramatic and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]''. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client of a prostitute killed in self-defense by [[Barbra Streisand]]'s character, Claudia Draper, in [[Martin Ritt]]'s courtroom drama ''[[Nuts (1987 film)|Nuts]]'' (1987).

===Later comedies===
After ''Airplane!'' and ''The Naked Gun'', Nielsen portrayed similarly styled roles in a number of other films. These mostly emulated the style of ''The Naked Gun'' with varying success and often targeted specific films; many were panned by critics and most performed poorly. ''[[Repossessed (film)|Repossessed]]'' (1990) and ''[[2001: A Space Travesty]]'' (2001) were parodies of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', respectively. Both attempted absurd comedy, but were poorly received.<ref name="RT5">{{cite web|title=Repossessed|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/repossessed/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="RT6">{{cite web|title=2001: A Space Travesty (2001)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/2001_a_space_travesty/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> Even a leading role in a [[Mel Brooks]] comic horror, ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'', failed to generate much box-office excitement, although it did gain a following in a later release to video. Both 1996's ''[[Spy Hard]]'' and 1998's ''[[Wrongfully Accused]]'', a parody of [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] and ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', were popular on video, but not well received by critics.<ref name="RT3">{{cite web|title=Spy Hard|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spy_hard/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="RT4">{{cite web|title=Wrongfully Accused|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wrongfully_accused/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref>

His attempt at children's comedies met additional criticism. ''[[Surf Ninjas]]'' (1993) and ''[[Mr. Magoo (film)|Mr. Magoo]]'' (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in ''Surf Ninjas'' was only "an extended cameo" and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers "avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen outside of the ''Naked Gun'' series."<ref name="Variety">{{cite news|last=Kimmel |first=Daniel M. |title=Surf Ninjas |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901158.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=daniel+and+kimmel&display=daniel+kimmel |date=23 August 1993 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ufX4w1gj?url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901158?refcatid=31 |archivedate= 2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name="DNews">{{cite news|last=Hicks |first=Chris |title=Surf Ninjas |work=[[Deseret News]] |url=http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/1,1257,1780,00.html |date=26 August 1993 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ufX7wXAO?url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700001778/Surf-Ninjas.html |archivedate= 2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Jeff Miller of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' panned ''Mr. Magoo'', a live-action remake of the [[Mr. Magoo|1950s cartoon]], by saying, "I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better, but I can't think of anything to say other than to make the film again."<ref name="HChron">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Looking for laughs?

Nielsen's first major success since ''The Naked Gun'' came in a supporting role in ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' (2003). His appearance as President Harris led to a second appearance in its sequel, ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'' (2006). This was the first time Nielsen had reprised a character since Frank Drebin. In one scene, Nielsen appeared almost [[Nudity|nude]], and one critic referred to the scene as putting "the 'scary' in ''Scary Movie 4''."<ref name="RVs">{{cite news|last=Berardinelli |first=James |title=Scary Movie 4 |publisher=ReelViews |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/scary_movie4.html |year=2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ufXByyQF?url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/scary_movie4.html |archivedate= 2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

===Video, stage, and celebrity productions===
Nielsen also produced instructional golf videos, which were not presented in a serious style, beginning with 1993's ''[[Bad Golf Made Easier]]''. The videos combined comedy with golf techniques. The series spawned two additional sequels, ''[[Bad Golf My Way]]'' (1994) and ''[[Stupid Little Golf Video]]'' (1997). Nielsen also co-wrote a fictional autobiography titled [[The Naked Truth (novel)|''The Naked Truth'']]. The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor with a long history of prestigious films.

In his 80s, Nielsen performed serious roles on screen and stage (such as his one-man theatre show ''Darrow'', in which he played [[Clarence Darrow]]), as well as providing voice-overs and appearances for commercials (including spots for a credit union in Arizona, where he owned a secondary residence), cartoons such as ''[[Zeroman]]'', where he had the leading role/voice, children's shows, such as ''Pumper Pups'', which he narrated, and comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, [[the Honourable]] [[Erik Nielsen]], a former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister of Canada]], served as the premise of an [[HBO]] [[mockumentary]] entitled ''[[The Canadian Conspiracy]]'' in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'', where he played ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', and ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' for charity.<ref name="CBS"/>

===Final acting years===
[[File:Leslie nielsen at moravian college.JPG|150px|thumb|right|Leslie Nielsen in March 2009 at [[DeSales University]] in [[Center Valley, Pennsylvania]]]]
Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen began playing a small role as a doctor in the humorous yet educational television show ''[[Doctor*Ology]]''. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the [[Discovery Channel]]. Nielsen said: "There are any number of things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries."<ref name="YahooNe">{{cite news|title=Legendary Leslie Nielsen reluctant to slow down at 81|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=2 March 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, Nielsen starred in the drama ''[[Music Within]]''. In 2008, he portrayed a version of [[Uncle Ben]] for ''[[Superhero Movie]]'', a spoof of [[superhero]] films. He then appeared in the 2008 parody ''[[An American Carol]]'', which David Zucker directed, produced, and co-wrote. He appeared in the 2009 parody ''[[Stan Helsing]]''.

<!-- Note: Nielsen's complete filmography of film and television takes up 220 listings according to The Internet Movie Database, not including appearances on television specials such as Circus of the Stars, game shows such as Match Point, and documentary narration. Obviously, that all can't fit in this article without making it a giant list. As such, if you choose to make an addition, please ensure there's a Wikipedia article for that listing and that it was an influential role in his career. -->
