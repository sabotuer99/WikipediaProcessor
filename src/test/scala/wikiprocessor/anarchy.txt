'''Anarchism''' is an [[anti-authoritarian]] [[political philosophy]]{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=59}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=27}} that advocates [[Self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary, [[cooperative]] institutions and the rejection of coercive [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] those societies view as unjust. These institutions are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]],{{r|group=note|Note01}}{{sfn|Sheehan|2003|p=85}} although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].{{r|group=note|Note02}} Anarchism holds the [[State (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.{{r|group=note|Note03}}><ref name=definition />< Any philosophy consistent with statelessness, that is, principled opposition to the State, is anarchist, thus anarchist schools of thought range from [[anarcho-communism]] to [[anarcho-capitalism]].{{sfn|Fiala|2018}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central,{{r|group=note|Note04}} many forms of anarchism specifically entail opposing authority or hierarchical organisation based on authority in the conduct of all human relations.{{r|group=note|Note05}} Anarchism is often considered a [[Far-left politics|far-left]] ideology,{{r|group=note|Note06}}{{sfn|Kahn|2000}}{{sfn|Moyihan|2007}} and much of [[anarchist economics]] and [[Anarchist law|anarchist legal philosophy]] reflect [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].{{r|group=note|Note07}}

Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.{{sfn|Marshall|2010|p=16}} Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc= Anarchism}} Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchism]] or similar dual classifications.{{sfn|Ostergaard|p=14|loc=Anarchism}}{{sfn|Kropotkin|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|1972}}

== Etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{see also|Anarchist terminology}}

The etymological origin of anarchism derives from ancient Greek word ''anarkhia''. ''Anarkhia '' meant ><without a ruler>< as it was composed by the prefix ><a><  (i.e ><without><) and the word ><arkhos>< (i.e leader or ruler). The suffix [[-ism]] is used to denote the ideological current that favours anarchism.{{sfn|Bates|2017|p=128}}{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} The first known use of this word was in 1642.{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster| 2019}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled opponents as anarchists (as [[Maximilien Robespierre]] did the [[Hébertists]]){{sfn|Dictionnaire des usages socio-politiques (1770–1815)|1985|p=9}} although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word ><anarchist>< or ><anarchism>< in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term ><[[libertarianism]]>< has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{r|group=note|Note08}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{r|Bundle01}} On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only, referring to free market anarchism as [[libertarian anarchism]].{{r|group=note|Note09}}

Defining anarchism is not an easy task. There is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a  cluster of political philosophies rejecting hierarchies (including the state and all associated institutions), in favour of a society based on voluntary association, freedom and decentralization. This definition though has its own shortcomings, as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''a posteriori'' concussion){{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=25-29}} Major elements of the definition of anarchism include a)the will for a non coercive society b)the rejection of State apparatus, c)belief in human nature, even though it is even harder to define it than anarchism d)a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=25-26}}

Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.{{r|Encarta}}

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Godwin]], was ><the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work>< according to Kropotkin.{{sfn|Kropotkin|1910}}]]
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.{{r|Everhart1982}}{{sfn|Philp|2006}} According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was ><the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work><{{sfn|Kropotkin|1910}} while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].{{r|group=note|Note14}}

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as [[philosophical anarchism]]. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793){{sfn|Philp|2006}}><ref name=><Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116><Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.></ref>< that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.{{sfn|Philp|2006}}{{sfn|Godwin|1796}}

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's ><mental enslavement>< the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work ''[[What is Property?]]'', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.{{sfn|Guerin|1970}} He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is ><Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order><. In ''What is Property?'', Proudhon answers with the famous accusation ><[[Property is theft]]><. In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed ><property>< (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to ><use and abuse>< their property as they wish.{{r|proudhon-prop}} He contrasted this with what he called ><possession><, or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that ><Property is Liberty>< and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.><ref><Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday >< Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33></ref>< His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain [[capitalist]] practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

The [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as ><[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]><.{{r|Dejacque}} Unlike Proudhon, he argued that ><it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature><.><ref><l'Echange><, article in ''Le Libertaire'' no 6, 21 September 1858, New York.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.

According to George Woodcock: ><These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s><.{{r|Woodcock1962|p=357}} According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': ><During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall [[Cantonal Revolution|attempted to establish a decentralised, or ><cantonalist,>< political system]] on Proudhonian lines><.><ref name=><britannica.com>< /><

Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: ><The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse—that they had split away from the Fédération Romande—was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers><.{{r|Woodcock1962}} In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included [[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers ([[Élie Reclus]] and [[Élisée Reclus]]) and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the ><implementation of the binding mandate>< in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.><ref><{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net|accessdate=30 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625232340/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|archivedate=25 June 2012}}></ref>< George Woodcock states that ><a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel><.{{r|Woodcock1962}}

Italian anarchists played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.><ref><Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 ><Daring but Divided><] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).></ref>< The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as ><the preventive counter-revolution><.{{sfn|Graham|2005}} In France, where the [[far-right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.><ref><Berry, David. ><Fascism or Revolution.>< ''Le Libertaire''.

=== Mutualism ===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.{{r|group=note|Note24}} Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a ><positive anarchy>< where order arises when everybody does ><what he wishes and only what he wishes><ref><Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.></ref>< and where ><business transactions alone produce the social order.><{{r|group=note|Note25}} Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive ><just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount><.{{r|group=note|Note28}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.><ref><Avrich, Paul.

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.><ref><{{cite book |author=Stuart Isaacs |author2=Chris Sparks |date=2004-05-20 |title=Political Theorists in Context |url={{google books|rlGFAgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=Routledge |p=248 |isbn=978-0-415-20126-1 }}></ref>< Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.><ref><Rocker, Rudolf. ''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice'' (2004). AK Press. p. 73.></ref>< Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or ><business agents><—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish CNT played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L.

[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]].

Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[syndicalism]]/[[trade unionism]] and [[capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society.

== Criticisms ==
Moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilization.

=== Allegation of utopianism ===
Anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a ><lesser evil>< than a society without ><repressive force><. He also argued that ><ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears>< is an ><absurdity><.><ref name=><landauer><Landauer, Carl (1959). ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements''.></ref>< However, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: ><Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies [as well as] some sort of ><court>< system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens><.><ref name=><Anarchist FAQ, perfect people><''An Anarchist FAQ''.

=== Anarchism and civilization ===
In his essay ''On Authority'', [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that radical [[decentralization]] promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilization, citing an example of [[railway]]s:><ref><Engels, Friedrich (1872).

In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}

Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.><[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm ><Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement>< by Barbara Epstein]
